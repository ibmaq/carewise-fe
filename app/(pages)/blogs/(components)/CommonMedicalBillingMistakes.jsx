        <h4>1. Inaccurate Patient Information</h4>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          One of the most common medical billing mistakes is inaccurate patient
          information. This can include incorrect names, addresses, dates of
          birth, or insurance information.
          <br />
          <br /> To avoid this mistake, ensure that your front-office staff is
          diligent about verifying patient information during the registration
          process.

        <h4>2. Insufficient Documentation</h4>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Insufficient documentation is another common mistake that can lead to
          denied claims and delayed payments.
          <br />
          <br /> To avoid this mistake, ensure that your healthcare providers
          are documenting all diagnoses, treatments, and procedures accurately
          and thoroughly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <h4>3. Incorrect Coding</h4>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Incorrect coding is a costly mistake that can lead to denied claims
          and audits.
          <br />
          <br /> To avoid this mistake, ensure that your coding staff is
          up-to-date with the latest coding guidelines and regulations.
        </p>

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <h4>4. Failure to Verify Insurance Eligibility</h4>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Failure to verify insurance eligibility is a mistake that can lead to
          denied claims and lost revenue.
          <br />
          <br /> To avoid this mistake, ensure that your front-office staff is
          verifying insurance eligibility for all patients before providing
          treatment.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <h4>5. Inefficient Claims Submission</h4>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Inefficient claims submission is a mistake that can lead to delayed
          payments and lost revenue.
          <br />
          <br /> To avoid this mistake, consider outsourcing your medical
          billing to a reputable company like Carewise.
